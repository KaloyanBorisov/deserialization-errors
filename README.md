Example use case:
During the development of event streaming applications, it is very common to have situations where some streams or tables are not receiving some events that have been sent to them. Often this happens because there was a deserialization error due to the event not being in the right format, but that is not so trivial to figure out. In this tutorial, we'll write a program that monitors a stream of sensors. Any deserialization error that happens in this stream will be made available in another stream that can be queried to check errors.
